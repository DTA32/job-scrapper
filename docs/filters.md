# Filter options

The `filter:` block in `config.yaml` drops jobs from the output before they
reach the JSON files. It runs after the recency filter (`max_age_hours`) and
before fields are projected for output.

> **Ordering:** for `linkedin`, `glints`, and `jobstreet`, both `filter:` and
> `max_age_hours` run **before** the per-site `limit` cap, so `limit` means "up
> to N jobs *after* filtering" — you reliably get up to N matches, not the first
> N parsed (which were often filtered down to zero). With no filter set,
> behavior is unchanged (still the first N). `indeed` caps at the API and is
> unaffected.

## Quick reference

```yaml
filter:
  location: [jakarta, bandung]
  employment_type: [full-time, internship]
  work_type: [remote, hybrid]
```

## Matching semantics

- **Substring** match, **case-insensitive**, against the job's canonical field
  value. `jakarta` matches `Jakarta`, `Jakarta Barat`, `Area DKI Jakarta`.
- **Within a key**: list-of-values is OR. `location: [jakarta, bandung]` keeps
  any job where `location` substring-matches `jakarta` OR `bandung`.
- **Across keys**: AND. Every declared key must match at least one of its
  candidate values for the job to survive.
- **Null fields are kept (conservative)**. If a site couldn't extract a field,
  the job is not penalized. Only an explicit non-matching value drops the job.
- **Single string** is shorthand for a 1-item list. `work_type: remote` is
  equivalent to `work_type: [remote]`.

## Per-key reference

### `location`

Free-form. There is no fixed enum — the value is whatever the source page
emits, normalized only by stripping/lowercasing for the comparison.

Examples observed across platforms (sample, not exhaustive):

```
jakarta              jakarta selatan        jakarta barat
jakarta timur        area dki jakarta       bandung
surabaya             semarang               bekasi
tangerang            batam                  bali
buleleng             cikarang               cilandak
indonesia            remote
```

Tip: a short substring catches multiple variants.
`location: jakarta` catches `Jakarta`, `Jakarta Barat`, `Jakarta Selatan`,
`Area DKI Jakarta`, etc. in one go.

### `employment_type`

Lowercase, hyphenated canonical set. Glints values are normalized at extraction
time (`FULL_TIME` → `full-time`).

Allowed values:

| Value         | Meaning                                       |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `full-time`   | Permanent full-time position                  |
| `part-time`   | Permanent part-time position                  |
| `contract`    | Fixed-term contractor / consultant            |
| `internship`  | Student or entry-level internship             |
| `freelance`   | Project-based / gig                           |

Coverage today: **Glints** reliably emits this field. Jobstreet, LinkedIn, and
Indeed currently emit `null` for this field and pass through the filter via the
null-rule. If you need strict matching across all sites, expect this filter to
have impact only on Glints' jobs for now.

### `work_type`

Lowercase canonical set.

Allowed values:

| Value     | Meaning                                                     |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `onsite`  | Employee works fully on company premises                    |
| `remote`  | Employee works fully remotely                               |
| `hybrid`  | Mix of onsite and remote (split varies per company)         |

Coverage today: **Glints** emits all three. Other sites currently emit `null`
and pass via the null-rule.

## Per-site override

A site-level `filter:` block fully replaces the global one (no deep-merge).

```yaml
filter:
  location: jakarta
  work_type: remote

sites:
  glints:
    enabled: true
    url_template: "..."
    filter:
      employment_type: full-time   # only this filter runs on glints
```

In this example, the global `location` and `work_type` filters do **not** apply
to Glints — only its own `employment_type: full-time` runs.

## Reading the runtime log

For each site, the runner prints how many jobs survived the filter:

```
[jobstreet:software-engineer] filter={'location': ['jakarta', 'bandung']} kept 1/5 (dropped 4)
```

The output JSON also records the filter that was applied:

```json
{
  "keyword": "software engineer",
  "max_age_hours": 24,
  "filter": {
    "location": ["jakarta", "bandung"],
    "employment_type": ["full-time", "internship"]
  },
  "count": 1,
  "jobs": [...]
}
```

## Common recipes

### Jakarta + nearby cities, full-time only

```yaml
filter:
  location: [jakarta, bekasi, tangerang, depok, bogor]
  employment_type: full-time
```

### Internships anywhere remote-friendly

```yaml
filter:
  employment_type: internship
  work_type: [remote, hybrid]
```

### Strict remote-only (Glints will dominate this)

```yaml
filter:
  work_type: remote
```

### Loosen further when filters return zero

If a combination yields empty output across all sites, drop the most
restrictive key first — typically `work_type` or `employment_type`. The
runtime log shows `kept N/M (dropped X)` per site so you can tell which
filter is doing the cutting.
